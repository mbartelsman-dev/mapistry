# Mapistry

A tool for generating realistic fictional maps, taking a procedural approach to generation.

Mapistry aims to be a robust and realistic tool that employs simplified models of known natural phenomena, such as plate tectonics, weather patterns, and erosion, to generate realistic worlds, while at the same time giving the user some degree of freedom to control the final output.

Because of the inherent size and complexity of the project, Mappistry cannot reasonably be a monolithic application. Instead, it will be a modular set of tools that can be piped together to achieve the desired results.

The starting goal for Mappistry is to replicate the functionality that Martin O'Leary describes in his article [Generating Fantasy Maps](http://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/). That is, a tool that can generate a realistically eroded map of a small region with square coordinates, as well as simple cultural features. Further developments after that point remain to be seen. One avenue that may be explored is to take the generation algorithm and adapt it to an entire globe, woth the possibility of plate tectonics simulation. A different avenue would be to implement a more complete and interactive cultural simulation. These goals are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
